# ns3-o-ran-e2

================================

This ns-3 module enables the support for running multiple terminations of an O-RAN-compliant E2 interface inside the simulation process. It has been developed as part of a collaborative effort between the [Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things (WIoT)](https://wiot.northeastern.edu) at Northeastern University, Mavenir, and the University of Padova.

## How to use

This module can be used with an extension of the [ns3-mmWave module](https://github.com/nyuwireless-unipd/ns3-mmwave) that will soon be released. The module needs to be cloned in the contrib folder. The [e2sim library](https://github.com/o-ran-sc/sim-e2-interface) needs to be installed.

We will provide further instructions as part of this README file.
